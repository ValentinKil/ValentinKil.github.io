I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford in the Department of Statistics. My project is supervised by <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/" class="special-link">François Caron</a> and <a href="https://bguedj.github.io" class="special-link">Benjamin Guedj</a>, and my research is supported by the Clarendon Scholarship.

**My research interests lie in :**
- **Statistical models for the analysis of real-world networks (sparse graphs)**
- **Anytime-valid methods for Statistics and Machine Learning**

I'm a Lecturer in Mathematics and Statistics at [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk)

I organise the <a href="https://youngstatmlseminar.github.io" class="special-link">Oxford Young Statistician Seminar</a>.

I regularly serve as a reviewer for conferences and journals including NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, and TMLR.

I was a <i>Normalien</i> (trainee civil servant) at the École Normale Supérieure de Rennes ([ENS Rennes](https://international.ens-rennes.fr)) in the Mathematics Department. 
In 2023, I studied in the [M2 Mathematics of Randomness](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-randomness)  at Paris-Saclay University. 
In 2022, I ranked 39th in the <i>[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrégation)</i>  of Mathematics.
