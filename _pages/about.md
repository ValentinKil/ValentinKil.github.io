I am a PhD student at University of Oxford in the Departement of Statistics. My project is supervised by [François Caron](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/) and [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io). My research journey is supported by the Clarendon Scholarship.



I was a <i>Normalien</i> (trainee civil servant) at the École Normale Supérieure de Rennes ([ENS Rennes](https://international.ens-rennes.fr)) in the Mathematics department. 
In 2023, I studied at the [M2 Mathematics of Randomness](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-randomness) at the Paris-Saclay University .
In 2022, I came 39th in the  <i>[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrégation)</i> of Mathematics.
