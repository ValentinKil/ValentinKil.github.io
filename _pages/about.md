I am a PhD student at University of Oxford in the Departement of Statistics. My project is supervised by <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/" class="special-link">François Caron</a>
 and <a href="https://bguedj.github.io" class="special-link">Benjamin Guedj</a>. My research is supported by the Clarendon Scholarship.

My research interests lie in the development of statistical models for the analysis of real-world networks (sparse graphs) and the applications of these models to machine learning.

I was a <i>Normalien</i> (trainee civil servant) at the École Normale Supérieure de Rennes ([ENS Rennes](https://international.ens-rennes.fr)) in the Mathematics department. 
In 2023, I studied at the [M2 Mathematics of Randomness](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-randomness) at the Paris-Saclay University .
In 2022, I ranked 39th in the  <i>[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrégation)</i> of Mathematics.
