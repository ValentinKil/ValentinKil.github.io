I am a <i>Normalien</i> (trainee civil servant) at the École Normale Supérieure de Rennes ([ENS Rennes](https://international.ens-rennes.fr)) in the Mathematics department. 

I am studying at the [M2 Mathematics of Randomness](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-randomness) at the Paris-Saclay University .

Last year, I came 39th in the  <i>[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrégation)</i> of Mathematics.

I am currently a research intern at the [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris) under the supervision of [Catherine Matias](http://cmatias.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Fanny Villers](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~villers/)
